byte newBit = (byte)(leftmostBit ^ tapBit);

int carry = newBit;

for (int i = seed.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int nextCarry = (seed[i] & MSB_BYTE_MASK) >> 7; 
    seed[i] <<= 1; 
    seed[i] |= (byte)carry; 
    carry = nextCarry;
}

i found it difficult to do the math for the tap bit and initial XOR operation
from chatGPT, I learned to do the carat sign and to cast to byte to make it work

I was also confused with the for loop for the carries, which chat gpt helped with.
